# levin-phase-floor campaign — implementation state

**Last updated:** 2026-10-25 · **Status: PLANNED — 0 of 4 measurement prompts landed.** 01 and 02
are written and can run at the same time, 01 on the Mac Studio and 02 on the laptop. 03 and 04 are
held. The remedy prompts are not written until gate G1.

The plan is [`README.md`](README.md), written on 2026-10-25 at `effba46`. Its audit is
[`docs/handover/A3-V2-FINDINGS.md`](../../docs/handover/A3-V2-FINDINGS.md) §2.

The campaign owns the depth-20 cost cliff of the `QuadSourceIntegral` Levin integration, and the
honesty of the error and convergence a row stores. It first runs findings §2.6's test, extended to
two named hypotheses, H-cancel and H-anchor (README §0.2). Then it lands the remedy layers G1
admits.

**Campaign:** [`README.md`](README.md) ·
**Code:** none in 01–04; the remedy's set after G1 ·
**Verification:** `docs/levin-phase-floor/VERIFICATION.md` (created by 01), with each prompt's
records in `docs/levin-phase-floor/NN/` ·
**Index:** [`docs/OPEN_ISSUES.md`](../../docs/OPEN_ISSUES.md) §1.24

> **Maintenance rule.** Whenever an entry is added to, narrowed in, or closed out of §3 or §4
> below, [`docs/OPEN_ISSUES.md`](../../docs/OPEN_ISSUES.md) is updated **in the same commit**: the
> row is added, moved or deleted, and the count and date in its header are corrected. An issue held
> on another board is narrowed or closed **there**. See `CLAUDE.md`.

### Decisions

**Made by the user, 2026-10-25 (README §6.1):**

| Decision | Decided |
|---|---|
| **U1** | Open this campaign from findings §2: the §2.6 test first, then the remedy |
| **U2** | A3 v2 analysis runs on the Mac Studio; the laptop's Ray is left to ChamPBH and StochasticInstantons |

The orchestrator's choices of method, C1–C6, are in README §6.2. The open questions for the user,
Q1–Q4, are in README §6.3.

## 1. Prompts

| # | Prompt | Covers | Where | Model | Written? | Landed? | Commit | Log |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | [The phase-group census of A3 v2](01-phase-group-census.md) | cost, regions and declared error per group; P1–P3; findings §2.5 on the store; the candidates for 03 | Mac Studio, read-only, no Ray | Opus | ✍️ 2026-10-25 | ⬜ | — | — |
| 02 | [Phase-noise injection](02-phase-noise-injection.md) | findings §2.6 item 2 on A2's fixtures, three arms; N1–N4 | laptop, offline, no Ray | Opus | ✍️ 2026-10-25 | ⬜ | — | — |
| 03 | instrument | findings §2.6 item 1 on rows 01 picks: depth per group, the parent–child discrepancy against the floor | Mac Studio | — | ⏸ held on 01 (its rows and groups) | ⬜ | — | — |
| 04 | remove | findings §2.6 item 3 in a harness: $k\tau_R$ out of $G$'s phase and/or the group composed before reduction; 03's rows again | Mac Studio | — | ⏸ held on 03 (which construction to test) | ⬜ | — | — |
| 05+ | remedy | §2.7 layers 1–2, as G1 decides | laptop | — | ⏸ held on G1 | ⬜ | — | — |

**Legend.** ✍️ written · ⏸ held, with what it waits on · ⬜ not yet · ✅ landed.

**This is a staged campaign, not a half-planned one.** README §2 fixes the charter of every held
prompt. Only its method waits on the measurement before it (README §6.2 C6).

**Orchestrator notes** are written just before dispatch, under `orchestrator/`. The planning
commit is `6af798f`. [`orchestrator/prompt-01.md`](orchestrator/prompt-01.md) (2026-10-25) dispatches 01
on the Mac Studio, orchestrated there, in parallel with `handover` 11 in the same checkout.

## 2. The gates

| Gate | Holds when | After | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | the user has read 01–04 and answered README §6.3 Q1–Q3: which hypothesis stands, which layer 1, and where it lands | 04 | ⬜ |
| **G2** | the user has answered Q4: the depth cap, the acceptance test and `total_converged` | the layer 1–2 prompts | ⬜ |

### 2.1 The hypotheses

| | Statement | Scored by | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H-cancel** | findings §2.2 as written: the floor matters where a group's large $\tau_s$ terms should cancel and do not (`G+r` on `r == k`) | 01 P1–P2; 03; 04 | open. The reconnaissance puts 52.7 % of the >100 s depth-20 cost in `G+r` (README §0.2) |
| **H-anchor** | $G$'s remainder, reduced against $z_{\rm response}$, carries $\varepsilon k\eta_R$ into every group containing $G$ | 01 P2–P3; 02 N3; 03 | open. The reconnaissance puts at least 40 % in groups with no cancelling pair |

They are not exclusive.

## 3. Active and unresolved issues

**None opened by this campaign.**

**Assigned here on 2026-10-25, held on their own boards** (README §1, §6.2 C5):
- `[a3-baseline-quadrature-tolerance-is-unreachable-on-squeezed-triangles]` — `handover` board §3;
- `[a3-baseline-unconverged-rows-are-stored-and-cannot-be-removed]` — `handover` board §3;
- `[02-levin-cost-growth-may-be-a-stale-Gk-phase-artefact]` — `handover` board §3;
- `[00-consumer-anchoring-floor]` — `GkTk-remedial` board §3.

**Measured here, not assigned:** `[04-roundoff-floor-can-be-infinite]` (`levin-refactor` board).
01 confirms whether it reaches A3 v2, and narrows it there.

## 4. Resolved issues

None.
